                    <p>My name is Seba, and I am an amateur developer. Since I was young, I've always had a great fascination for computers, and use them on a daily basis. Ive been told stories of how when I was about 6 years old I mastered using a portable DVD player (honestly debatable, I don't buy it). That kickstarted my interest in computers, and I would always be super excited when new tech entered the household, like with my dad getting the iPhone 4, new computers, and stuff like that. I'd always ask to set them up for my parents. I've also unfortunately been guilty of bricking many family computers due to pumping them with viruses trying to get Minecraft for free. Luckily I've perfected the art of getting games for free but I won't tell ;)</p>

                <p>I got into the development of this game in early 2021, but had been using Construct 2 since 2019 on and off because I borrowed a license from a friend. I made little prototypes of platformers and stuff, but never really took off with a proper project. In 2021, I decided that I wanted to actually create a proper game with Construct 3, so I made ideas and started development on this game. I actually got quite far into development (see image on the right), with a proper shooting system, loadout system with weapons, advanced movement such as rolling, and working AI which I was very proud of figuring out (albeit with a lot of help from a guy in the Construct discord, (shoutout to Federico Calchera!)). Unfortunately after a long time I decided that the engine I was working on too hard to work with, plus the system that I had created had a catastrophic flaw in it that I would have to rework from scratch, so I gave up on using Construct.</p>

                <p>After a long time of no progress, I decided to finally use Unity as the new engine for my game. This was going to be a daunting task, as Unity uses a completely different system for game objects. It is also written in C#, as opposed to Construct's codeless language. This wouldn't pose too much of an issue though, because I have an intermediate knowledge of C#, but I needed to learn unity's engine and its systems. This would prove quite difficult, so I bought an online course that was very helpful and key in furthering my knowledge in game development. The development of the game has been very slow since moving to unity, as I need to completely rethink my design with the game, as I can no longer use 3D geometry, due to issues with the render pipeline. This is the latest progress I have made on the game, and while it is a lot less than my work on Construct, I am very proud of it because it is very hard to code on Unity, and a lot more gratifying when you get something right.</p>
